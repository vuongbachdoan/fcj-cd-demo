# Building a Call Center with Amazon Bedrock Assistant and Whisper for Voice-to-Text

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to create a call center solution that integrates Amazon Bedrock as an AI assistant and uses OpenAI's Whisper model for real-time voice-to-text transcription. The implementation will utilize Amazon SageMaker to deploy Whisper and Amazon Bedrock to enhance the interaction with AI-driven responses.
